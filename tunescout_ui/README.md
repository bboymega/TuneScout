## TuneScout User Interface Deployment

You can use Docker to easily deploy the TuneScout UI Service.

Simply pull the docker image:
```
docker pull bboymega/tunescout_ui:v1.0.0
```
Prepare your `config.json`. Create your configuration file based on the example provided at the end of this readme.

Spin up a container with the following command:
```
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v /path/to/your/config.json:/app/app/config.json bboymega/tunescout_ui:v1.0.0
```

**FOR PRODUCTION**: Set up a reverse proxy using Apache2 or Nginx to expose the service securely through HTTPS.

## Features

- **Audio Recording**: Record audio directly from the interface and recognize music from the recording.

- **File Upload**: Upload audio or video files for recognition.

- **Media Trimming**: Select and recognize specific portions of uploaded media files.

- **Custom Branding & External URLs**: Personalize the UI with custom branding and add external URLs for additional services or resources.
